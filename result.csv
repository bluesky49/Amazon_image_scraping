Find your perfect grind with the Titleist Vokey Design SM8 Wedges. Bob Vokey’s 6 Tour-proven sole grinds give all golfers a set of wedges fit for their swing type and course conditions. Finely-tuned Progressive Center of Gravity placement achieves improved trajectory, distance control and feel. The Spin Milled groove cutting process and 100% quality inspection prove nothing spins like a Vokey.

HIT YOUR NUMBER:
Vokey recommends 4° - 6° of loft separation between your wedges, resulting in 10-15 yard gaps
ONE GIANT SHIFT FORWARD:
The shift that will reshape your wedge game. SM8 features a center of gravity that is pushed forward from the face, through the use of high density tungsten, producing a more consistent, pure strike that helps you hit your target more often.

For golfers, this means improved feel, improved ball flight, and a club face that simply wants to square at impact for more consistent results.",Titleist SM8Wedge.jpg,https://dks.scene7.com/is/image/GolfGalaxy/20TTLUSM8CSTMXXXXWDG?wid=1400&fmt=jpg

Proprietary JAWS groove design combines with Groove-In-Groove Technology to create incredible spin and unparalleled short game control. Loft-optimized weighting and a soft 8620 Carbon Steel construction enable uniquely satisfying feel.

More Options to Lower Your Score - Selecting Sole Grind:
JAWS MD5 Wedges are available in 5 grind options, each with generous camber from heel to toe for smooth turf interaction and soft feel
C-Grind: Increased relief, especially at the heel, making it easier to play shots with the face open. Ideal for medium to shallow attack angles and/or firm course conditions. (8° Bounce)
S-Grind: Medium-width sole with slight camber at the back and moderate heel relief to keep the leading edge low through impact, promoting solid contact on open-faced shots. (10° Bounce)
W-Grind: Sole is wider at the center and toe, and narrower at the heel, with moderate heel relief and generous front-to-back camber. That prevents digging without increasing bounce, and keeps the leading edge close to the turf at impact. Great for open-faced shots and more versatile than the previous W-Grind. (12° Bounce)
Low Bounce W-Grind:Direct result of Tour player feedback that delivers increased playability around the green while providing moderate heel relief and generous front-to-back camber. Great for playing a wider variety of greenside shots.
X-Grind: Features a narrow, high-bounce crescent sole with the low point near the front. Excellent for moderate to steep attack angles and medium-to-soft course conditions (12° Bounce)
The New Standard for Wedge Performance
Most vigorously tested and Tour-validated wedge Callaway has ever offered
Tour refined shapes, sole grinds and camber make it easier to create clean contact on tight lies for greater control
4 weight ports and milled aluminum medallions enables positioning of the CG progressively upward as loft increases for solid feel on every shot
Club head constructed of soft 8620 Carbon Steel to equip golfers with a uniquely satisfying feel
New JAWS Groove Design with Groove-In-Groove Technology
New JAWS groove design creates groove-edge sharpness for maximum grip and spin control
Proprietary Groove-In-Groove Technology is saw-cut and horizontally milled to precise tolerances for spin
Lower-lofted wedges (52° and below) feature a 20D groove for more consistent spin on fuller shots
Higher-lofted wedges (54° and up) feature an aggressive 5D groove for maximum control out of the rough and around green
Each 16-groove configuration features Callaway’s extra “Nip It” groove near the leading edge for added spin control
Micro-Positive Surface Roughness milled into the flat parts of the face enable increased spin on a variety of shots
3 raised micro ridges extend the length of the hitting area to grab golf ball’s cover and deliver Tour-level spin control
Combination of grooves + micro grooves provides 84 contact points for the face to grab the ball’s cover
